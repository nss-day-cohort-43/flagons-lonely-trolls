# flagons-lonely-trolls

The purpose of this app is to create a game app that heavily relies on components as well as working in a focused team.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives of this project, by the end of the client side course, are the following.

* Identifying and building components
* Using `fetch` to store and retrieve data from a persistent data store.
* Handling browser-generated and custom events
* Understanding asynchronous programming
* Collecting user input and acting on it
* Modular CSS
* Modular JavaScript

## Description

The user first begins by creating a team and then creating their personal user profile. While creating their user profile they will be asked to choose their forever team. Once there are three teams with three players you can begin the age old game of Truncheons and Flagons! Below you will find the rules to this game.

## The Most Popular Tavern Game of the Middle Ages

![](./images/tattered-flagon.jpeg)

In the roaring 1130's, peasants and serfs across Europe and Western Asia popularized a tavern game known as Truncheon & Flagons. Scholars believe that the game originated in the Tattered Flagon tavern located in Southern Aragon, near the city of Jara.

Since it was not an official game of the royalty or merchant classes at the time, writings about it are rare and often vague. However, what modern anthropologists have been able to piece together paint a picture of an odd, fun, and sometimes violent game - depending on how drunk the contestants became.

The rules of the game were fairly simple, yet allowed for some subtlety.

1. There are three teams in a game of Truncheon & Flagons.
    * The Knights
    * The Fairies
    * The Goblins
1. Each team has three players.
1. Six flagons of ale, mead, or wine are be arranged on a table. Four flagons making the corners of a square, and the fifth and sixth being placed in the middle of the square. The table should be in an area of a tavern where the teams had some ability to move around.
1. Teams rotated between being the Knights, Fairies, and Goblins after each round.
1. The Knights have to throw a small wooden ball into one of the flagons. Each Knight has their own ball.
1. Each Knight that successfully throws a ball into a flagon earns 2 points for the Knights.
1. Each Knight that successfully throws a ball that lands on the table earns 1 point for the Knights.
1. The Goblins guard the flagons by swinging small truncheons to knock the ball out of the air before it landed in a flagon or on the table.
1. Each Goblin that successfully knocks a thrown wooden ball out of the air earns 1 point for the Goblins.
1. The Fairies can distract the Knights or the Goblins.
1. If a Fairy distract a Knight enough that a ball is dropped, or thrown out of the playing area, the Fairies receive 1 point.
1. If a Fairy distracts a Goblin enough so that a thrown ball lands anywhere in the playing area _(on the table or in a flagon)_ without any defensive truncheon swings, the Fairies receive 1 point.
1. There are three rounds so that each team can play each role.
1. At the end of round three, whichever team has the most points earns the honor of drinking the contents of the six flagons.
